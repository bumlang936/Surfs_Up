## Purpose of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to gather temperature data for the months of December and June in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year round. By examining average temperatures for the hottest and coldest months of the year, we could see if the weather is warm enough throughout the year to where customers would still have a desire to surf and/or enjoy some ice cream. Temperature is a very important factor in order to see if the business can be sustainable for the whole year.
