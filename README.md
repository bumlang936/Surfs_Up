## Purpose of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to gather temperature data for the months of December and June in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. By examining average temperatures for the hottest and coldest months of the year, we could see if the weather is warm enough throughout the year to where customers would still have a desire to surf and/or enjoy some ice cream. Temperature is a very important factor to see if the business can be sustainable for the whole year. 


## Results
Below are the temperature statistics for the months of June and December.

June temperature statistics:

December temperature statistics:

There are some key differences between these two summaries: 
- June's average temperature was about 3.9 degrees hotter than December's with an average of 74.944118 degrees compared to December's 71.041529 degrees. 
- December's lowest temperature was 8 degrees colder than June's with a minimum temperature of 56 degrees compared to June's 64 degrees. 
- June's max temperature was only 2 degrees warmer than December's with a max temperature of 85 degrees compared to December's 83 degrees. 


## Summary
Based on the temperature summaries for June and December, it can be concluded that the surf and ice cream shot business would most likely be sustainable throughout the whole year. From the statistics, it shows that the temperature remains constant during the hottest and coldest months. Not only that, but the average temperatures for the two months are warm enough to draw toursits to the shop whether they desire to surf or eat ice cream. Since the coldest month averages over 71 degrees, then it can be assumed that the average temperature for the other months would be over 71 degrees as well. However, one could argue that January or February might be considered the coldest months out of the year instead of December. I would like to see additional queries that show the temperature statistics for every month to help provide a more confident answer on whether the shop will be sustainable throughout the whole year. Another query I'd like to see is how often it rains for each month to further ensure confidence in whether or not the shop will be sustainable throughout the year. If it shows that Oahu receives quite a bit of rain throughout the year, then that would have a big impact on the shop's sustainability. If it rains for a decent amount of the year, then the shop may not last the whole year since people would be turned off from surfing or eating while it's raining.
